/*
Write a program that displays a simulated paycheck. 
The program should ask the user to enter the date, 
the payeeâ€™s name, and the amount of the check (up to $10,000). 
It should then display a simulated check with the dollar amount spelled out, as shown here:
                                                   Date: 11/24/2021 
     Pay to the Order of: John Phillips            $1920.85  
     One thousand nine hundred twenty and 85 cents 
Be sure to format the numeric value of the check in fixed-point 
notation with two decimal places of precision. Be sure the 
decimal place always displays, even when the number is zero 
or has no fractional part. Use either C-strings or string class objects in this program.
Input Validation: Do not accept negative dollar amounts, or amounts over $10,000.
