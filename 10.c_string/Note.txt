#include <cctype> need to include when using isupper() and islower()
Inside of isupper() and islower() can be a character 'c' or a character variable
Beside of these 2 member function, we also have isdigit():  which return true if char is a number
isalpha(): return true if char is in alphabet

c string is a string that store in char array

#include <cstring> is need when using c string, with is different from normal string
Define cstring: 
  char name[] = "This is a random sentences."
can use subscript to access each element of c string

#include<cstring> also critical when using cstring member function
Ex: int length
    length = strlen(something);
something must be one of the following:
  + a name of the array holding the ctring
	  Ex: char name[] = "I am a Crab"; then something can be name
	+ A pointer variable that hold address of C string
	  Ex: char* ptr = name; then something can be ptr
		IMPORTANT: strlen() do not accept nornal string variable
	+ a literal string
Reason: strlen() or cstring menber function as general only access address;
	
strcat: Concatenates, or appends one string to another
Ex:
  const int size = 13;
  char string1[size] = "Hello ";
  char string2[] = "World!";
  strcat(string1, strin2);
  cout << string1 << endl;
Result: Hello World
Note:
  + it is the programmer's responsibility to make sure there is a white space between two string
	+ size of string1 must large enough to hold both string after concatenation
	+ Algorith to make sure we have enough space:
	____________________________________________________________________
	  if (sizeof(string1) >= (strlen(string1) + strlen(string2) + 1)) {
		  strcat(string1, string2);
		} else {
		  cout << "String1 is not large enough for both string.\n";
		}
  _____________________________________________________________________
	Explain: We use sizeof() at the beginnign because if return the size of string1 in byte, also each character occupies one byte to it make sense here
	         strlen() return the number of character that c string hold, which not include null character at the end of the concatenated string, but sizeof() include null
					 that is why whe have to add 1 in the left of the operator.


strcpy: member function used to coppy one string to another, which normal array cannot do, overide if string1 is already stored something.
Ex: 
const int SIZE = 10; 
char string1[SIZE] = "Hello", string2[SIZE] = "World!"; 
cout << string1 << endl; 
cout << string2 << endl; 
strcpy(string1, string2); 
cout << string1 << endl; 
cout << string2 << endl; 
Output:
Hello 
World! 
World! 
World!


Use strncat() and strncpy instead of strcat and strcpy
strncat():
int maxChars; 
const int SIZE_1 = 17; 
const int SIZE_2 = 18; 
 
char string1[SIZE_1] = "Welcome "; 
char string2[SIZE_2] = "to North Carolina"; 
 
cout << string1 << endl; 
cout << string2 << endl; 
maxChars = sizeof(string1) − (strlen(string1) + 1); 
strncat(string1, string2, maxChars); 
cout << string1 << endl; 
strncpy():
int maxChars; 
const int SIZE = 11; 
 
char string1[SIZE]; 
char string2[] = "I love C++ programming!"; 
 
maxChars = sizeof(string1) − 1; 
strncpy(string1, string2, maxChars); 
// Put the null terminator at the end. 
string1[maxChars] = '\0'; Because strncpy do not automatically place null terminator if maxChars is less than or equal lenght
cout << string1 << endl; 


strstr(string1, string2): searches for a string inside a string. First argument is the string to be searches, second argument
is the string for which to looks. If found, it return the ADDRESS of the occurrence of the second string within the first string.
Otherwise, it return null.
Ex program:
// This program uses the strstr function to search an array. 
#include <iostream> 
#include <cstring> // For strstr 
using namespace std; 
 
int main() 
{ 
    // Constants for array lengths 
    const int NUM_PRODS = 5; // Number of products 
    const int LENGTH = 27;   // String length 
 
    // Array of products 

    char lookUp[LENGTH];     // To hold user's input 
    char *strPtr = nullptr;  // To point to the found product 
    int index;               // Loop counter 
 
    // Prompt the user for a product number. 
    cout << "\tProduct Database\n\n"; 
    cout << "Enter a product number to search for: "; 
    cin.getline(lookUp, LENGTH); 
 
    // Search the array for a matching substring 
    for (index = 0; index < NUM_PRODS; index++)     // This is important, we dont use int index becuase it will make index become local variable 
    {                                               // and it won't be accessebale outside of its scope.
        strPtr = strstr(products[index], lookUp); 
        if (strPtr != nullptr) 
            break; 
    } 
 
    // If a matching substring was found, display the product info. 
    if (strPtr != nullptr) 
        cout << products[index] << endl; 
    else 
        cout << "No matching product was found.\n"; 
 
    return 0; 
}

strcmp: The function takes two C-strings as parameters (actually, pointers to C-strings) and returns an integer result. The value of the result is set accordingly:
  The result is zero if the two strings are equal on a character-by-character basis.
  The result is negative if string1 comes before string2 in alphabetical order.
  The result is positive if string1 comes after string2 in alphabetical order.
Ex 1:
// This program tests two C-strings for equality 
// using the strcmp function. 
#include <iostream> 
#include <string> 
using namespace std; 
int main() 
{ 
    // Two arrays for two strings. 
    const int LENGTH = 40; 
    char firstString[LENGTH], secondString[LENGTH]; 
 
    // Read two strings. 
    cout << "Enter a string: "; 
    cin.getline(firstString, LENGTH); 
    cout << "Enter another string: "; 
    cin.getline(secondString, LENGTH); 
 
    // Compare the strings for equality with strcmp. 
    if (strcmp(firstString, secondString) == 0) 
       cout << "You entered the same string twice.\n"; 
    else 
       cout << "The strings are not the same.\n"; 
 
    return 0; 
} 
Ex 2:
// This program uses strcmp to compare the string entered 
// by the user with the valid MP3 player part numbers. 
#include <iostream> 
#include <cstring> 
#include <iomanip> 
using namespace std; 
 
int main() 
{ 
    // Price of parts. 
    const double A_PRICE = 99.0, 
                 B_PRICE = 199.0; 
 
   // Character array for part number. 
   const int PART_LENGTH = 9; 
   char partNum[PART_LENGTH]; 
 
   // Instruct the user to enter a part number. 
   cout << "The MP3 player part numbers are:\n" 
        << "\t16 Gigabyte, part number S147–29A\n" 
        << "\t32 Gigabyte, part number S147–29B\n" 
        << "Enter the part number of the MP3 player you\n" 
        << "wish to purchase: "; 
 
   // Read a part number of at most 8 characters. 
   cin >> partNum; 
 
   // Determine what user entered using strcmp 
   // and print its price. 
   cout << showpoint << fixed << setprecision(2); 
   if (strcmp(partNum, "S147–29A") == 0)           // if (!strcmp(firstString, secondString)) can be used for shorter because strcmp return 0, which also logical mean false.
      cout << "The price is $" << A_PRICE << endl; 
   else if (strcmp(partNum, "S147–29B") == 0) 
      cout << "The price is $" << B_PRICE << endl; 
   else 
      cout << partNum << " is not a valid part number.\n"; 
   return 0; 
}

Summary:
strlen﻿	Accepts a C-string or a pointer to a C-string as an argument. Returns the length of the C-string (not including the null terminator.)

Example Usage: len = strlen(name);
strcat	Accepts two C-strings or pointers to two C-strings as arguments. The function appends the contents of the second string to the first C-string. (The first string is altered, the second string is left unchanged.)

Example Usage: strcat(string1, string2);
strcpy	Accepts two C-strings or pointers to two C-strings as arguments. The function copies the second C-string to the first C-string. The second C-string is left unchanged.

Example Usage: strcpy(string1, string2);
strncat	Accepts two C-strings or pointers to two C-strings, and an integer argument. The third argument, an integer, indicates the maximum number of characters to copy from the second C-string to the first C-string.

Example Usage: strncat(string1, string2, n);
strncpy	Accepts two C-strings or pointers to two C-strings, and an integer argument. The third argument, an integer, indicates the maximum number of characters to copy from the second C-string to the first C-string. If n is less than the length of string2, the null terminator is not automatically appended to string1. If n is greater than the length of string2, string1 is padded with ‘\0’ characters.

Example Usage: strncpy(string1, string2, n);
strcmp	Accepts two C-strings or pointers to two C-strings arguments. If string1 and string2 are the same, this function returns 0. If string2 is alphabetically greater than string1, it returns a negative number. If string2 is alphabetically less than string1, it returns a positive number.

Example Usage: if (strcmp(string1, string2))
strstr	Accepts two C-strings or pointers to two C-strings as arguments. Searches for the first occurrence of string2 in string1. If an occurrence of string2 is found, the function returns a pointer to it. Otherwise, it returns nullptr (address 0).


String/numberic conversion function:


C-String/Numeric Conversion Functions in <cstdlib>
atoi: Accepts a C-string as an argument. The function converts the C-string to an integer and returns that value.
Example Usage: int num = atoi("4569");

atol: Accepts a C-string as an argument. The function converts the C-string to a long integer and returns that value.
Example Usage: long lnum = atol("500000");

atof﻿: Accepts a C-string as an argument. The function converts the C-string to a double and returns that value.
Example Usage: double fnum = atof("3.14159");﻿

Better way to get input without worry about cin.ignore() and cin.clear(): 
// This program demonstrates how the getline function can 
// be used for all of a program's input. 
#include <iostream> 
#include <string> 
#include <iomanip> 
using namespace std; 
 
int main() 
{ 
   string input;   // To hold a line of input 
   string name;    // To hold a name 
   int idNumber;   // To hold an ID number. 
   int age;        // To hold an age 
   double income;  // To hold income 
 
   // Get the user's ID number. 
   cout << "What is your ID number? "; 
   getline(cin, input);     // Read as a string 
   idNumber = stoi(input);  // Convert to int 
 
   // Get the user's name. No conversion necessary. 
   cout << "What is your name? "; 
   getline(cin, name); 
 
   // Get the user's age. 
   cout << "How old are you? "; 
   getline(cin, input);  // Read as a string 
   age = stoi(input);    // Convert to int 
 
   // Get the user's income. 
   cout << "What is your annual income? "; 
   getline(cin, input);   // Read as a string 
   income = stod(input);  // Convert to double 
 
   // Show the resulting data. 
   cout << setprecision(2) << fixed << showpoint; 
   cout << "Your name is " << name 
        <<", you are " << age 
        << " years old,\nand you make $" 
        << income << " per year.\n"; 
 
   return 0; 
}

    // Get a string from the user. 
    cout << "Enter a string (up to 50 characters): "; 
    cin.getline(userString, SIZE); 
 
    // Choose a character whose occurrences within the string will be counted. 
    cout << "Enter a character and I will tell you how many\n"; 
    cout << "times it appears in the string: "; 
    cin >> letter; 
 
    // Display the number of times the character appears. 
    cout << letter << " appears "; 
    cout << countChars(userString, letter) << " times.\n"; 
    return 0; 
} 
 
//******************************************************************

Several way to initialize string object:
Definition	Description
string address;	Defines an empty string object named address.
string name("William Smith");	Defines a string object named name, initialized with
“William Smith.”
string person1(person2);	Defines a string object named person1, which is a copy of person2. person2 may be either a string object or character array.
string str1(str2, 5);	Defines a string object named str1, which is initialized to the first five characters in the character array str2.
string lineFull('z', 10);	Defines a string object named lineFull initialized with 10 'z' characters.
string firstName(fullName, 0, 7);	Defines a string object named firstName, initialized with a substring of the string fullName. The substring is seven characters long, beginning at position 0.


Normal string member function	
mystring.append(n, 'z')	Appends n copies of 'z' to mystring.
mystring.append(str)	Appends str to mystring. str can be a string object or character array.
mystring.append(str, n)	The first n characters of the character array str are appended to mystring.
mystring.append(str, x, n)	n number of characters from str, starting at position x, are appended to mystring. If mystring is too small, the function will copy as many characters as possible.
mystring.assign(n, 'z')	Assigns n copies of 'z' to mystring.
mystring.assign(str)	Assigns str to mystring. str can be a string object or character array.
mystring.assign(str, n)	The first n characters of the character array str are assigned to mystring.
mystring.assign(str, x, n)	n number of characters from str, starting at position x, areassigned to mystring. If mystring is too small, the functionwill copy as many characters as possible.
mystring.at(x)	Returns the character at position x in the string.
mystring.back( )	Returns the last character in the string. (This member function was introduced in C++ 11.)
mystring.begin( )	Returns an iterator pointing to the first character in the string. (For more information on iterators, see Chapter 16.)
mystring.c_str( )	Converts the contents of mystring to a C-string, and returns a pointer to the C-string.
mystring.capacity( )	Returns the size of the storage allocated for the string.
mystring.clear( )	Clears the string by deleting all the characters stored in it.
mystring.compare(str)	Performs a comparison like the strcmp function (see Chapter 4), with the same return values. str can be a string object or a character array.
mystring.compare(x, n, str)	Compares mystring and str, starting at position x, and continuing for n characters. The return value is like strcmp﻿. str can be a string object or character array.
mystring.copy(str, x, n)	Copies the character array str to mystring, beginning at position x, for n characters. If mystring is too small, the function will copy as many characters as possible.
mystring.empty( )	Returns true if mystring is empty.
mystring.end( )	Returns an iterator pointing to the last character of the string in mystring. (For more information on iterators, see Chapter 17.)
mystring.erase(x, n)	Erases n characters from mystring, beginning at position x.
mystring.find(str, x)	Returns the first position at or beyond position x where the string str is found in mystring. str may be either a string object or a character array.
mystring.find('z', x)	Returns the first position at or beyond position x where 'z' is found in mystring. If 'z' is not found, the function returns the special value string::npos.
mystring.front( )	Returns the first character in the string. (This member function was introduced in C++ 11.)
mystring.insert(x, n, 'z')	Inserts 'z' n times into mystring at position x.

mystring.replace(x, n, str)	Replaces the n characters in mystring beginning at position x with the characters in string object str.
mystring.resize(n,  'z')	Changes the size of the allocation in mystring to n. If n is less than the current size of the string, the string is truncated to n characters. If n is greater, the string is expanded and 'z' is appended at the end enough times to fill the new spaces.
mystring.size( )	Returns the length of the string in mystring.
mystring.substr(x, n)	Returns a copy of a substring. The substring is n characters long and begins at position x of mystring.
